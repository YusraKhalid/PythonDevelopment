Made entirely of lightweight pebble-washed organic cotton, its double-face fabric gives it a rich, multi-dimensional look. At first glance you\u2019ll notice large scale buffalo check plaid in fresh, seasonal colors. Upon closer inspection, you\u2019ll see that mini-buffalo check or striped pattern facings accent the inner yoke, inner cuff, sleeve placket and the underside of the collar. Front princess seaming creates a contoured look; a hidden security pocket is set into the left front seam. Bias-cut patch pockets add additional interest. Convertible sleeves roll up and secure with a button tab. Available in The Original Buffalo Check\u2122 plaid, created by Woolrich in 1850.",

Polyester canvas and neoprene lining in our signature red and a panel of Original Buffalo Check wool trim give it a decidedly Woolrich flair. But what makes this backpack really work is its ingenious pocket construction that delivers secure storage for all your necessities. On the outside, three snap closure pockets: a front pocket complete with pen slots and two side pockets for water bottles or umbrellas. In addition, two hidden pockets (one in front and one in back) secure with waterproof zippers. Top \"clamshell\" opening has a durable YKK zipper closure, with one interior and one exterior pocket, both with waterproof zippers. Inside, a padded laptop sleeve with a Velcro closure holds a tablet or laptop (up to 13\"); two open slip pockets stow smaller items, and a zippered back wall pocket adds extra security. Padded mesh back panel and shoulder straps; side cinch closures minimize bulk.",

    "description": "Find casual comfort with polished details in our Hemp/Cotton Blend Hoodie. It\u2019s a 4.5 oz. hemp cotton blend, with a touch of spandex for stretch and shape retention, that\u2019s been boulder-washed for that soft, broken-in feeling from the first wear. Pullover styling is made even easier with a half-zip front closure. Half-zip front and drawcords at the hood give some versatility in terms of warmth. Below the half-zip closure you\u2019ll find a generous front kangaroo pocket. We finished this piece with button-close cuffs on the sleeves.",

    "description": "The iconic Arctic Parka has been reimagined in a slimmer silhouette and outfitted with a detachable raccoon fur ruff, and designed with new colors for the season. Ramar cloth shell is Teflon\u2122 coated to be wind-, rain- and snow-resistant. Quilted lining is insulated in 70% grey duck down, 30% feathers. Front has a two-way full-length zip-closure and concealed button-through storm placket with a hidden snap near the bottom hem. Two flap-closure hand-warmer pockets. Rib-knit storm cuffs, logo throat latch with hook-and-loop closure, and zip-off fur ruff all block cold drafts and help keep you toasty warm. This parka is available in our slim fit, our closest fit that sits against the body; for a roomier fit, order a size up.",

    "description": "This plaid shirt is so warm and soft, you'll want to wear it indoors and out - from the first frost to the last snowfall. We start with chunky, 7 oz. heavyweight cotton flannel, then boulder-wash it and brush both sides for extraordinary softness. Plus it is double-layered throughout the forearm, back yoke and front placket. The Oxbow can be worn tucked in, and is long enough to be worn outside the waistband as a lightweight shirt jacket. Made from 100% cotton. See below for additional information. Available in The Original Buffalo Check \u2122 plaid, created by Woolrich in 1850.",

    "description": "The 3-in-1 Stag Field Down Jacket gives you 3 great styles in 1: the water-repellant cotton shell and removable insulated vest can be worn separately or together, covering a wide range of cold and wet conditions. Shell has a removable hood that snaps on and off around the collar, full-length zip-closure front with button-through storm placket and hidden snap near the bottom hem, and plenty of pockets: waterproof zip-closure right chest pocket, left welt pocket with concealed snap-flap closure, and two lower dual-entry patch pockets with concealed snap-closure flaps. Internal waist adjustment and ergonomic sleeve and shoulder panels add shaping and ease of movement. Removable vest features full-length zip-closure front that doubles as the means of securing it to the shell. Insulated in 90% down, 10% feathers, with a rib-knit comfort collar, two zip-closure front pockets, zip-closure internal pocket, and internal bottom hem regulation. This 3-in-1 jacket is available in our regular fit, a trimmer fit with minimal excess fabric.",
