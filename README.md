Getting Started

    Clone this repo on your local machine.
    Create a new branch with your name like alisufian-master (lower case).
    Push this empty branch.
    For every assigned task create a new branch e.g. alisufian-borjanspider.
    When the task is complete make sure the code confirms to pep8.
    Push the code and create a pull request against your name-master branch.
    Specify the title of the PR as name-task e.g. Ali Sufian - Weatherman so its easy to find in the list.
    In case you mess up the repo.

Do not add log files, temp files, data files etc. Do not merge/push anything into master branch.
