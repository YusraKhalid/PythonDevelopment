We did this by using a new last, the footform that gives the upper its shape. This last fits more true to size and has a slightly wider and higher toebox allowing the foot to spread out more naturally at toeoff. Also, the upper of the GT-2000\u00ae 7 shoe has been enhanced with a new engineered mesh for a glove-like fit over the top of the foot. This mesh has been engineered to give more support to areas of the upper where the foot needs it and less to others for better breathability.  These enhancements combine to make the GT-2000\u00ae 7 one comfortable running shoe. Make no mistake\u2014the GT-2000\u00ae 7 running shoe has plenty of stability, designed for athletes who love to run. The added stability comes in part from the DYNAMIC DUOMAX\u00ae support system, positioned under the heel and middle of the foot to guard against overpronation, or the excessive inward rolling of the foot just after the foot hits the ground. FLYTEFOAM\u00ae technology is layered over the DYNAMIC DUOMAX\u00ae support system for responsive cushioning, helping you run farther, while supersoft SPEVAFOAM\u00ae midsole material, just under the foot, reduces impact to minimize the strain on your body.  Reliable grip is vital for any runner, and the GT-2000\u00ae 7 shoe has got that covered. The durable AHAR\u00ae rubber outsole in the heel and lightweight AHAR\u00ae rubber in the forefoot is designed to offer extra traction, keeping you stable on any road surface. This durable compound also protects the shoes against damage that can be caused by long-term wear.  Simply put, the GT-2000\u00ae 7 shoe takes care of all the details, leaving you to focus on enjoying your run.  Weight: 8.67. Heel Height: 21mm.

The classic ASICS Trusstic System and Underlay support provide stability in the midfoot area, while Guidance line technology reduces any imbalance in your feet as you run, helping you achieve a more centred stride. A Duomax Medial midsole creates added shock absorption to reduce the impact of hard surfaces on your feet and joints.  The outsole is made from abrasion-resistant AHAR that ensures these shoes are suitable for long-term use.
